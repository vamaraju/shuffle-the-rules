Do the following to get started with JavaFX (on Windows).

1. Download the Java 8 JDK from Oracle. Get the 64bit version (jdk-8u121-windows-x64.exe).
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Note: JavaFX comes built in to Java. Once you install the Java 8 JDK, you technically have JavaFX already installed.

2. Install the JDK (from the installer downloaded in Step 1).

3. Download JavaFX Scenebuilder from Gluon (the Windows 64 bit version). This application helps build GUI's in JavaFX.

4. Download JavaFX Ensemble. It is a package that contains a variety of examples for JavaFX.

5. Install Apache Ant. This is used to build and run JavaFX projects.
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
http://apache.mirror.globo.tech//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.10.1-bin.zip

6. Unzip Apache Ant to C Drive root. After unzipping, there should be a folder called "apache-ant-1.10.1" in C Drive root.

7. Add JAVA_HOME, JRE_HOME, and ANT_HOME to your environment path, and update PATH.
In Windows:
Right Click the Windows Button -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced Tab -> Environment Variables
In the bottom half (System Variables), click "New", and add the following:

JAVA_HOME
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121

JRE_HOME
C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_121

ANT_HOME
C:\apache-ant-1.10.1

In the System Variables, find "Path", and double click it. To the end of the string, add:
;%ANT_HOME%\bin

Make sure you keep the semi-colon as the first character! This separates the new entry from the previous entries.

8. You can close the Environment Variables window now (click OK). You may need to restart your computer for these changes to 
take effect, but you shouldn't need to.

9. You can now use JavaFX SceneBuilder and JavaFX Ensemble as desired.

To compile a JavaFX program:

1. Download the Drag-and-Drop JavaFX program (as an example) from here:
http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/drag_drop/jfxpub-drag_drop.htm
http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/drag_drop/hellodraganddrop.zip

2. Unzip the directory to a place of your choice. Navigate to the directory.

3. Open a Command Prompt in the unzipped directory.

4. Run the following command in the root of the directory (where build.xml is):
ant

This will attempt to compile the program using Apache Ant. build.xml contains the settings for the compilation.

5. The compile will fail because a certain path isn't set. To bypass this, run in the Command Prompt:
ant -Dplatforms.Default_JavaFX_Platform.home="%JAVA_HOME%" jar

6. The test program is now compiled. To run it, navigate to the "dist/" folder, and run "HelloDragAndDrop.jar" (double-click).
